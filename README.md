# Online Store (v1.2)

## Recent Update: Jan 2025

v1.2 updates a few meta tags, adds versioning in the footer, adds links to
personal website, githb and linkedin. Also adds attributions for all images.

## About this project

This project was made for a web development and design course. It was limited to
using just vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML -- so no front wnd frameworks. It
does make slight use of Bootstrap.

It is a responsive multi-page website that showcases a fictional store. Complete
with a cart that updates in real time with dynamic elements.

## Challenges and Solutions

The most difficult thing for me was implementing the form and input elements on
the contact page. I have used a lot of forms, but usually with the help of
third-party libraries and React which makes developing and integrating with
state so much easer.

I was able to address this major challenge by researching how all input elements
worked together, and making sure that client-side validation was done before
user submission could be done for these inputs. I think this is really important
to modern applications, since security and data integrity need to be taken
seriously.

## Conclusions and Future Implementations

There are a few things that can be added to make this project more well-rounded
bar in the navigation bar doesn't actually work, neither does clicking on the
cards for items ont he home or products page.

I think making these dynamic and changing the state of the application when
these are interacted with could make for a more fluid web project.
